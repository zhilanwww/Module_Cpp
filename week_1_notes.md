int root;

Legal: This declares an integer variable named "root."
int ROOT;

Legal: C++ is case-sensitive, so "ROOT" is considered a different identifier than "root."
int rOOT6;

Legal: C++ is case-sensitive, and the combination of uppercase and lowercase characters is allowed.
int 44root;

Illegal: Identifiers cannot start with a number. Therefore, "44root" is not a valid identifier.
int 44root;

Illegal: This is a duplicate of option 4. It's not a valid identifier.
int +r00t;

Legal: While using the plus sign at the beginning of an identifier is unusual, it is technically legal. However, it's not recommended for clarity.
int root-11;

Illegal: The hyphen '-' is not allowed in variable names. This declaration is not valid.
int root ;

Legal: This declares an integer variable named "root." The extra spaces around the variable name are allowed but not necessary.
