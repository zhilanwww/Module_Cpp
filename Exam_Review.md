# Week 1
## Fundamentals

* Define the variables before input.

double x;
cin >> x;

* Variable Names

Case sensitive, consists of letters, numbers and _, starting with a letter or _, canâ€™t use reserved words

* Type Casting

Type casting to solve the problem with integer division.

  * answer = double(numerator) / denominator;
  
  Do NOT use
  
  * answer = double(numerator / denominator);

  Eg. double (5 / 2) 
  
  In this example, the result will be 2.0 instead of the expected 2.5. This is because numerator / denominator performs integer division, resulting in 2, and only then is it cast to a double.
